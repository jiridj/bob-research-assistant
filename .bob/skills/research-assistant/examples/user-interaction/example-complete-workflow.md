# Example: Complete Research Workflow

This example demonstrates a full end-to-end research workflow from project initialization to final report delivery.

## Scenario

A product manager needs to research API management trends to inform their 2024 technology strategy. They have 2 weeks to deliver an executive summary and full research report.

## Complete Conversation

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

```
User: "I need to research API management trends for our 2024 strategy. Can you help?"

Bob: "I'd be happy to help you research API management trends. Let me understand your needs:

1. What's your primary goal?
   - Market analysis
   - Vendor comparison
   - Trend identification
   - Technology evaluation
   - All of the above

2. What's your timeline?

3. What deliverables do you need?

4. Do you have existing sources or should I help you find them?"

User: "I need to identify key trends and compare top vendors. Timeline is 2 weeks. I need an executive summary and a full report. I have some Gartner and Forrester reports, plus I want to look at vendor documentation."

Bob: "Perfect! I'll set up a comprehensive research project.

Project scope:
- Trend identification
- Vendor comparison
- Timeline: 2 weeks (due June 26)
- Deliverables: Executive summary + full report
- Sources: Analyst reports + vendor docs

Creating project structure...

✓ Created: research/api-management-trends-2024/
  - Project metadata with timeline
  - Source tracking
  - Analysis templates
  - Report templates

Next steps:
1. Convert your Gartner and Forrester reports
2. Scrape vendor documentation
3. Analyze for trends
4. Create vendor comparison
5. Generate reports

Let's start with your analyst reports. Where are they located?"

User: "They're in ~/Downloads/analyst-reports/"

Bob: "Let me check what's in ~/Downloads/analyst-reports/...

Found 3 PDFs:
1. gartner-magic-quadrant-api-management-2024.pdf (45 pages)
2. forrester-wave-api-management-2024.pdf (38 pages)
3. idc-marketscape-api-management-2024.pdf (42 pages)

I'll convert these to markdown and add them to your project.

Conversion settings:
- Output: sources/analyst-reports/
- Images: Excluded (text-only for analysis)
- Naming: Descriptive with year

Proceed?"

User: "Yes, convert them all"

Bob: "Converting 3 analyst reports...

✓ 1/3: gartner-magic-quadrant-api-management-2024.md (45 pages)
✓ 2/3: forrester-wave-api-management-2024.md (38 pages)
✓ 3/3: idc-marketscape-api-management-2024.md (42 pages)

✓ All reports converted successfully
✓ Added to research/api-management-trends-2024/sources/
✓ Updated source index

Total: 125 pages of analyst content

These reports cover:
- Market positioning and vendor landscape
- Technology trends and predictions
- Vendor capabilities and comparisons

Next, which vendors would you like to research?
Common choices: Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, MuleSoft"

User: "Let's focus on Kong, Apigee, and AWS API Gateway"

Bob: "Great choices - those are the top 3 in most analyst reports.

For each vendor, I can scrape:
- Features and capabilities
- Architecture documentation
- Pricing information
- Use cases and best practices

Which content is most important for your comparison?
1. All of the above (comprehensive)
2. Features and pricing only (focused)
3. Let me select specific pages"

User: "Get features and pricing for all three"

Bob: "I'll scrape features and pricing pages for Kong, Apigee, and AWS API Gateway.

Target URLs:
Kong:
- https://konghq.com/products/kong-gateway/features
- https://konghq.com/pricing

Apigee:
- https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/capabilities
- https://cloud.google.com/apigee/pricing

AWS API Gateway:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html
- https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/

Output: sources/vendor-docs/[vendor]/

Proceed?"

User: "Yes"

Bob: "Scraping vendor documentation...

✓ 1/6: Kong features (850 lines)
✓ 2/6: Kong pricing (340 lines)
✓ 3/6: Apigee capabilities (720 lines)
✓ 4/6: Apigee pricing (280 lines)
✓ 5/6: AWS API Gateway overview (650 lines)
✓ 6/6: AWS pricing (420 lines)

✓ All vendor pages scraped successfully
✓ Added to research/api-management-trends-2024/sources/
✓ Updated source index

Total: 3,260 lines of vendor documentation

I discovered 12 related pages that might be useful:
- Kong: Architecture, plugins, deployment
- Apigee: Analytics, security, integrations
- AWS: Best practices, tutorials, case studies

Would you like me to scrape these as well, or proceed with analysis?"

User: "Proceed with analysis. Start with trend identification."

Bob: "I'll analyze the 3 analyst reports to identify API management trends.

Analysis approach:
1. Read each report thoroughly
2. Extract trend mentions and analysis
3. Categorize by theme (technology, market, adoption)
4. Identify patterns across sources
5. Rank by frequency and importance
6. Note predictions and timelines

This will take a few minutes. Proceed?"
